# Sentiment-Analysis-as-Stress-Detector
Machine learning methods are being increasingly tested to identify specific features of stress.
Computer systems can access a constant stream of public social web texts and those that are embedded within communication applications may also store private messages

➡️Biological stress refers to changes within the body, such as heartrate increases, in response to an unusual stimulus or challenge and in order to prepare for a response.

➡️Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

➡️The second alternative method of stress measurement as sentiment analysis is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, and computational linguistics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis could analyze people’s opinions, appraisals, attitudes, and emotions towards many entities such as products, services, organizations, phenomena, issues, subjects, and their attributes.

➡️The interdisciplinary research (using both psychological and informative tools and approaches) confirmed that there is a high and positive correlation between the psychometric stress measurement results, based on an established survey and sentiment analysis results by data set.
